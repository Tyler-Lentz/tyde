A custom IDE developed mainly for fun and to learn Rust and Svelte through Tauri. I'm basically looking at VSCode and trying to implement whatever features I can, plus some others that I think are interesting.

- syntax highlighting
- code autocomplete
- in app stack overflow search
- in app ChatGPT prompts
- dedicated subway surfers tab (high priority)
