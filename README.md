A custom IDE developed mainly for fun and to learn Rust and Svelte through Tauri. I'm basically looking at VSCode and trying to implement whatever features I can, plus some others that I think are interesting.

## Current Functionality
- open/save files
- open directory and view all files in directory
- detect when edited file is unsaved
- console that logs file operations

## TODO

### Short Term
- directory view updates in real time if file system changes
- save as option
- in-app terminal

### Long Term
- navigation shortcuts
- Vim keybindings
- configurable themes
- syntax highlighting
- code autocomplete
- in app stack overflow search
- in app ChatGPT prompts
- dedicated subway surfers tab (high priority)
